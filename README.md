Description: This project was created to become an income tool which is going to help us to get the amount that we need to pay to our employees each month, processing
a txt file. 
You are going to be asked for the txt file to proceed however, you can leave it empty and the project will run the process over the EmployeesTestFile.txt, you can also modify 
the data over there if you want to try with more inputs. 
So far, the project is running with the inputs cases that were assigned. 

TODO: There is many places and things that we can improve in the code, some of them are; handling expections, custom validations, 
remove duplicated code, implement test project.
